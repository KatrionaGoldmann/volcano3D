The volcano3D package enables exploration of probes differentially 
expressed between three groups. Its main purpose is for the
visualisation of differentially expressed genes in a three-dimensional
volcano plot. These plots can be converted to interactive visualisations using
plotly. 

The [vignette](file:///Users/kgoldmann/Documents/Analyses/volcano_package/volcano3D/docs/articles/Extended_Vignette.html) 
explores a case study from the PEAC 
rheumatoid arthritis trial (Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort). 
The methodology has been published in 
[Lewis, Myles J., et al. _Molecular portraits of early rheumatoid arthritis 
identify clinical and treatment response phenotypes_. Cell reports 28.9 (2019): 
2455-2470.
(DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.091)
with an interactive web tool available at 
[https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk](https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk).  

This tool acts as a searchable interface to examine relationships between 
individual synovial and blood gene transcript levels and histological, clinical, 
and radiographic parameters, and clinical response at 6 months. 
An interactive interface allows the gene module analysis to be explored for 
relationships between modules and clinical parameters. 
The PEAC interactive web tool was creating as an 
[R Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) and deployed to the web using a server. 

There are also supplementary vignettes for further information on:

- Using the volcano3D package to perform 2x3-way analysis. In this type of analysis there is a binary factor such as drug response (responders vs non-responders) and a 2nd factor with 3 classes such as a trial with 3 drugs. See [here](https://katrionagoldmann.github.io/volcano3D/articles/Vignette_2x3.html).
- Using the volcano3D package to create and deploy a shiny app. See [here](https://katrionagoldmann.github.io/volcano3D/articles/shiny_builder.html).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
* [ggpubr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/index.html)
* [plotly](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html)

### Install from CRAN

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/volcano3D)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=volcano3D)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("volcano3D")
```

### Install from Github

[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/KatrionaGoldmann/volcano3D.svg)](https://GitHub.com/KatrionaGoldmann/volcano3D/tags/)


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("KatrionaGoldmann/volcano3D")
library(volcano3D)
```

### volcano3D data

The sample data can then also be installed either from 
[source](https://github.com/KatrionaGoldmann/volcano3Ddata) or using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("KatrionaGoldmann/volcano3Ddata")
```

## Citation

volcano3D was developed by the bioinformatics team at the 
[Experimental Medicine & Rheumatology department](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/emr/) 
and [Centre for Translational Bioinformatics](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/) at 
Queen Mary University London.
