Description: This package provides a tool for analysis and visualisation of 
three-class high dimensional data. It is particularly suited to visualising 
differences in continuous attributes such as gene/protein/biomarker expression 
levels between three groups. Differential gene/biomarker expression analysis 
between two classes is typically shown as a volcano plot. However, with three 
groups this type of visualisation is particularly difficult to interpret. This 
package generates 3d volcano plots and 3-way polar plots for easier 
interpretation of three-class data.
